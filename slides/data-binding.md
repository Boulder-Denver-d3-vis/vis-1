# Fundamental D3 Concepts

*** 

 * Data Binding
 * Enter, Exit, and Update sections
 * Function generators and callbacks

Note:
Data binding - associating an array of data with an array of elements
Enter, exit: "what to do when the data and the document are out of sync"
Update: "What to do when data and document are in sync"
Function generators: builds a function for you from a configuration
Callbacks: how data-dependent attributes are set.
