## The Meetup

***

A place for hands on learning about visualization.

I'm focused on D3, but there are lots of other tools out there.

Note:
You probably saw the note I sent out about getting GitHub going on your computer.
I want this to be a place that we get into the details
Whenever possible, presentations should have a way for the group to be hands-on.
